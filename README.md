Revised maps with the following principles:
- No editing terrain from old packs.
- Huts
-- Moved spawn huts as far OOB as possible. Hut entrance in mission area, to minimize interactions after players enter mission area
-- Move spawn huts farther up or towards ski routes to allow multiple easy routes into play
- Mission area
-- Add visual markers for the OOB grids
-- Pull mission area inwards to speed up play and avoid "dead zones" where making plays is too difficult

Install, move or extract .vl2 (paths on) to Tribes2/GameData/base
